In any Bank Transaction, there are several parties involved to process transaction like a merchant, bank, receiver, etc. so there are several numbers reasons that transaction may get failed, declined, so to handle a transaction in Java, there is a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) which provides us an API to connect, execute, fetch data from any databases. It provides the language Java database connectivity standards. It is used to write programs required to access databases.

Transactions in JDBC provide us a  feature that considers a complete SQL statement as one unit,  then executes once, and if any statement fails, the entire transaction fails. To use transaction, we have to set setAutoCommit(false); manually, and once all the statements are executed successfully, making changes in the databaseâ€™s commit() method will be required. 

In this Mini Banking Application, to handle a transaction, we are using JDBC Transaction to make transactions consistent.  This Application Provides Menu-Driven Console Interface to a User Using that User can perform functions like create Account, Login, View Balance And Transfer Money To The Other Customer.
